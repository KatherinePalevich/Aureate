# Aureate


## Support
Aureate eliminates the need for a separate journal, planner, and habit tracker through combining them into one app that is easy and intuitive to navigate!

Sections of the app allow you to keep track of habits, upcoming events, and journal to your heart’s content. Aureate is connected to your Apple Calendar, where push notifications remind you to complete tasks early so that you stay on top of assignments well before their due date. Events can be viewed in a daily or weekly view. The To-Do section allows you to quickly add tasks to be completed, which disappear after you’ve completed them. Habits can be tracked for a week, month, year, or custom number of days.0 comments on commit ba54eae
