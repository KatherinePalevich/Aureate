Aureate is an iOS application I wrote for an Independent Studies Computer Science class. I enjoy maintaining an organized life and keeping track of tasks, whether they are big or small. I've learned that journaling, planning, and keeping track of tasks and habits is the key to a sound mind. Combined with my passion for programming, I created this app to share these tools with the world.

Sections of the app allow you to keep track of habits, upcoming events, and journal to your heart’s content. Aureate is connected to your Apple Calendar, where push notifications remind you to complete tasks early so that you stay on top of assignments well before their due date. Events can be viewed in a daily or weekly view. The To-Do section allows you to quickly add tasks to be completed, which disappear after you’ve completed them. Habits can be tracked for a week, month, year, or custom number of days.
